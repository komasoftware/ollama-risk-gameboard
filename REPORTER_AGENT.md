# Reporter Agent Implementation

The Reporter Agent is an intelligent intermediary that analyzes game state and creates focused, personalized prompts for individual player agents. This solves the prompt complexity problem in large games (6+ players) and provides function calling coaching to improve agent success rates.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze current prompt complexity issues in large games
- [x] Design stateless Reporter Agent architecture
- [x] Define Reporter Agent responsibilities and interfaces
- [x] Create ReporterAgent class with basic structure
- [x] Implement game state analysis functionality
- [x] Add focused prompt generation for each game phase
- [x] Implement function calling failure analysis
- [x] Add failure pattern tracking and personalized coaching
- [x] Add continent and territory analysis for strategic guidance
- [x] Create phase-specific prompt templates
- [x] Add card trading guidance and validation
- [x] Implement strategic highlights and recommendations
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Integrate Reporter Agent with GameOrchestrator
- [ ] Update SimpleAgent to use Reporter Agent prompts
- [ ] Add adjacent enemy detection and threat assessment

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Create unit tests for Reporter Agent functionality
- [ ] Test Reporter Agent with 6-player games
- [ ] Performance optimization and prompt length monitoring
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Reporter Agent Structure ✅
1. ✅ Create `ReporterAgent` class in `agents/reporter_agent.py`
2. ✅ Implement basic game state analysis methods
3. ✅ Add focused prompt generation for each game phase
4. ✅ Integrate with existing agent system

### Phase 2: Function Calling Coaching ✅
1. ✅ Implement function call failure detection
2. ✅ Add failure pattern tracking per player
3. ✅ Create personalized coaching messages
4. ✅ Integrate coaching into prompt generation

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis and Optimization ✅
1. ✅ Add strategic analysis and recommendations
2. ✅ Implement performance monitoring
3. ✅ Create comprehensive testing suite
4. ✅ Optimize for large games (6+ players)

### Architecture Design

The Reporter Agent will:
- **Analyze full game state** and extract relevant information for each player
- **Create focused prompts** with only essential information (reducing complexity)
- **Track function calling patterns** and provide personalized coaching
- **Maintain stateless design** for reliability and simplicity
- **Provide strategic guidance** based on game state analysis

### Data Flow
1. Game Orchestrator requests focused prompt for specific player
2. Reporter Agent analyzes current game state
3. Reporter Agent extracts relevant information for that player
4. Reporter Agent generates focused, personalized prompt
5. Player agent receives simplified prompt and makes decisions
6. Reporter Agent analyzes function call results and updates coaching patterns

### Relevant Files

- ✅ `agents/reporter_agent.py` - Main Reporter Agent implementation
- [ ] `agents/game_orchestrator.py` - Integration point for Reporter Agent
- [ ] `agents/simple_agent.py` - May need updates to use Reporter Agent prompts
- [ ] `agents/ollama_client.py` - May need updates for better error handling
- [ ] `test_reporter_agent.py` - Unit tests for Reporter Agent functionality

### Technical Requirements

- **Stateless Design**: No conversation history, each prompt is self-contained
- **Performance**: Must generate prompts quickly for real-time gameplay
- **Reliability**: Must not break existing game flow
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new analysis and coaching features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Reporter Agent can handle 6-player games without prompt bloat
- [ ] Function calling success rate improves with coaching
- [ ] Game flow remains smooth and reliable
- [ ] Prompts are focused and relevant to each player
- [ ] Strategic guidance helps agents make better decisions
