# Data Collection Summary for Risk AI Agents

## 🎯 Current Status

We have successfully collected comprehensive game state data using **Python-based sampling** (no shell scripts needed). We now have data covering all major game scenarios.

## 📊 Data Files Generated

### **1. Comprehensive Game State Data**
- **File**: `game_state_samples.json` (1.6MB)
- **Samples**: 55 game state samples
- **Coverage**: Basic game progression across 3 turns
- **Actions**: Reinforce only (simple strategy)

### **2. Enhanced Game State Data**
- **File**: `enhanced_game_state_samples.json` (1.6MB)
- **Samples**: 55 game state samples
- **Coverage**: Aggressive gameplay with border reinforcement
- **Actions**: Reinforce, Attack, Fortify
- **Strategy**: Border territory focus for aggressive positioning

### **3. Training Examples**
- **File**: `training_examples.json` (988KB)
- **Examples**: 55 training examples for AI agents
- **Format**: Context, state, and available actions
- **Purpose**: Direct AI agent training

## 🎮 Scenarios Captured

### **✅ Successfully Captured:**

#### **Game Phases:**
- **Setup**: Initial game state (1 sample each)
- **Reinforce**: Army placement strategies (18 samples each)
- **Attack**: Combat scenarios (18 samples each)
- **Fortify**: Army movement between territories (18 samples each)

#### **Game Actions:**
- **Reinforce**: Army placement on territories
- **Attack**: Combat between territories
- **Fortify**: Army movement between connected territories

#### **Strategic Elements:**
- **Border Reinforcement**: Aggressive positioning on enemy borders
- **Territory Control**: Multiple players with 14 territories each
- **Army Distribution**: 35-38 total armies per player
- **Phase Progression**: Complete turn cycles

### **⚠️ Not Yet Captured (Need Longer Games):**
- **Card Trading**: Requires territory conquests to get cards
- **Territory Conquest**: Need successful attacks that eliminate defenders
- **Move Armies**: Post-conquest army movement
- **Continent Control**: Complete continent ownership bonuses

## 🔍 Data Analysis Results

### **Phase Distribution:**
- **Setup**: 1 sample (initial state)
- **Reinforce**: 18 samples (army placement)
- **Attack**: 18 samples (combat scenarios)
- **Fortify**: 18 samples (army movement)

### **Player Progression:**
- **Player 0**: 4 turns, 37.7 average total armies
- **Player 1**: 3 turns, 35.0 average total armies
- **Player 2**: 3 turns, 35.0 average total armies

### **Game Balance:**
- **Territories**: 14 per player (balanced distribution)
- **Reinforcement**: 1.2 average armies per turn
- **Action Availability**: 14 possible actions consistently

## 🚀 Usage for AI Development

### **For Training AI Agents:**
```bash
# Use the training examples directly
python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('training_examples.json')); print(f'Available training examples: {len(data)}')"
```

### **For Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze the comprehensive data
python analyze_samples.py
```

### **For Specific Scenarios:**
- **Reinforce Strategy**: Use samples with "reinforce" phase
- **Attack Strategy**: Use samples with "attack" phase
- **Fortify Strategy**: Use samples with "fortify" phase
- **Border Defense**: Use samples with "border: True" descriptions

## 📈 Next Steps for Complete Coverage

### **To Capture Missing Scenarios:**

1. **Longer Game Sampling**: Run games for 5-10 turns to get card trading
2. **Aggressive Attack Strategy**: Focus on high-probability attacks for conquests
3. **Card Trading Focus**: Sample games specifically when players have 3+ cards
4. **Continent Control**: Sample games where players control entire continents

### **Enhanced Sampling Strategy:**
```python
# Run longer games with more aggressive strategies
sampler.sample_enhanced_game(num_players=3, max_turns=10)
```

## 🎯 Current Capabilities

### **✅ What We Can Do Now:**
- Train AI agents on basic game mechanics
- Test reinforce, attack, and fortify strategies
- Analyze game state patterns
- Benchmark agent performance
- Develop strategic positioning logic

### **🔄 What We Need for Full Coverage:**
- Card trading scenarios (need conquests)
- Territory conquest patterns (need successful attacks)
- Continent control bonuses (need complete continent ownership)
- End-game scenarios (need longer games)
