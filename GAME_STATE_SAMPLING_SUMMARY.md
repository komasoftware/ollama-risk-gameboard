3. **Scenario Detection**: Identify meaningful scenarios (continent control, conquest, etc.)
4. **File Organization**: Save with descriptive filenames including turn phases
5. **Analysis Processing**: Generate statistics and training examples
6. **Summary Reporting**: Provide concise overview of collected data

### Key Components
- **Sampling Engine**: Automated gameplay with state capture
- **Scenario Detector**: Smart identification of meaningful game states
- **File Manager**: Descriptive filename generation and organization
- **Analysis Engine**: Statistical analysis and training data generation
- **Reporting System**: Concise summary with scenario counts

### Environment Configuration
- Risk API server running on localhost:8000
- Python 3.12+ with requests, json, pathlib dependencies
- Test data directory structure with organized scenario files

## Results Summary

### **Data Collection**
- **55 game state samples** collected across 3 turns with 3 players
