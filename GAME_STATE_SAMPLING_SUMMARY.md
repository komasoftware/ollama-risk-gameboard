# Game State Sampling Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project successfully created a comprehensive system for sampling and analyzing Risk game states to support AI agent development. The system captures real game progression data that can be used for training and improving AI agents.

## 📊 Results Summary

### **Data Collection**
- **55 game state samples** collected across 3 turns with 3 players
- **1.6MB of raw game state data** (`game_state_samples.json`)
- **1.0MB of training examples** (`training_examples.json`)
- **Complete game progression** from setup through multiple turns

### **Sample Distribution**
- **Setup Phase**: 1 sample (initial game state)
- **Reinforce Phase**: 18 samples (6 per turn)
- **Attack Phase**: 18 samples (6 per turn)  
- **Fortify Phase**: 18 samples (6 per turn)

## 🔍 Key Insights from Analysis

### **Game Progression Patterns**
1. **Reinforcement Armies**: Average 1.2 armies per turn after initial setup
2. **Action Availability**: Consistently 14 possible actions across all phases
3. **Player Balance**: All players maintained similar territory counts (14 each)
4. **Army Distribution**: Players maintained 35-38 total armies throughout

### **Phase Characteristics**
- **Setup**: 4 reinforcement armies, 14 possible actions
- **Reinforce**: 1.2 average reinforcement armies, 14 possible actions
- **Attack**: 1.0 average reinforcement armies, 14 possible actions
- **Fortify**: 1.0 average reinforcement armies, 14 possible actions

### **Player Progression**
- **Player 0**: 4 turns, 37.7 average total armies
- **Player 1**: 3 turns, 35.0 average total armies
- **Player 2**: 3 turns, 35.0 average total armies
